          <li>Still off social media sites (since the beginning of October)... but I can't always stay logged out. Text me pictures of your dogs & kiddos, please!</li>
          <li>^ Probably going to write a Medium post about this soon. ^</li>
          <li>Bullet Journaling in my personal life to be more productive (being off of Instagram, FB & Twitter has helped with this a lot, to be fair)</li>
          <li>Trying out Bullet Journaling at work, too, and it's been helpful so far.</li>
          <li>Figuring out which holiday things I want to see & do in & around Boston this year.</li>
          <li>Brainstorming fun stocking stuffer gifts, which is the approach my family is taking for gift exchanges this year.</li>
