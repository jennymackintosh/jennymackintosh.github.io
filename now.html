        		<h1>What's Jenny up to lately?</h1>
			<h2>December 2019/January 2020</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Returned to social media in December and it didn't add what I thought it would, so I'm back offline until... not sure! The experiment continues.</li>
				<li>Went quiet on my Bullet Journal over the holidays, but I'm back into it for the new year, to keep better track of my goals & day-to-day life.</li>
				<li>Been desperately trying to downsize my possessions as a path to a happier apartment life, which is a hard task for me. Trying to find new perspectives that help me to let go of Capital-S-Stuff.</li>
				<li>This month: Making as many plans with friends as I can, especially people I didn't see during the holiday craziness.</li>
				<li>Trying to wrap my head around a tropical vacation locale in February enough to firm up plans with Brian (neither one of us has been to a tropical destination before.)</li>
				<li>Taking stock of the music I loved most in 2019, and who I most want to see live in 2020.</li>
				<li>Incorporating more of these things in January: Long walks, BA-tested vegetable recipes, reading, baby-sized knitting (for my nephew!), documentaries.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>November 2019</h2>
			<ul>
         			<li>Still off social media sites (since the beginning of October)... but I can't always stay logged out. Text me pictures of your dogs & kiddos, please!</li>
          			<li>^ Probably going to write a Medium post about this soon. ^</li>
          			<li>Bullet Journaling in my personal life to be more productive (being off of Instagram, FB & Twitter has helped with this a lot, to be fair)</li>
          			<li>Trying out Bullet Journaling at work, too, and it's been helpful so far.</li>
          			<li>Figuring out which holiday things I want to see & do in & around Boston this year.</li>
          			<li>Brainstorming fun stocking stuffer gifts, which is the approach my family is taking for gift exchanges this year.</li>
