        		<h1>What's Jenny up to lately?</h1>
			<h2>March–June 2020</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Sooo... the world is a little different since I updated last... *screams internally & externally*</li>
				<li>Wrestling with how to be Out In The World when it's not always fair for folks on the other side (read: going to restaurants or the supermarket puts a burden on the people working more than it does me.)</li>
				<li>We're ordering takeout and buying things from small businesses we <3 through mail and contactless pickup. It's diversified our buying habits and made us (I think) more mindful about where our money is going and why. Shouts to a couple of our local businesses, who have kept us fed, happy and properly masked over the past few months: <a href="https://www.alliummarket.com/" target="_blank">Allium Market</a>, <a href="https://gatherhereonline.com/" target="_blank">gather here</a>, <a href="https://www.stokedpizzaco.com/" target="_blank">Stoked</a> & <a href="https://publickhousebrookline.com/" target="_blank">the Publick House</a>.</li>
				<li>Currently listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6PzcVM8Z1GMqeGlMBQ6ikX?si=jGUPuX07RJSe7wggeYyPbg" target="_blank"><i>Stamped from the Beginning – The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America</i></a> by Ibram X. Kendi on Spotify. Might need to just buy a hard copy because it's great but a suuuper information-dense text that I want to highlight/reference. (P.S., did you know that Ibram X. Kendi <a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2020/ibram-x-kendi-leading-scholar-on-racism-to-join-bu/" target="_blank">is now running a center out of Boston University?</a>)</li>
				<li>Brian and I are both deep into Animal Crossing. Message me for a friend code. I'm reading up on the best ways to get hybrid flowers... turns out the game mechanics around flower breeding are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ARIQCUc5YVEd01D7jtJT9EEJF45m07NXhAm4fOpNvCs/" target="_blank">based in real plant genetics</a>, which is delightful.</li>
				<li>Through all of this, we celebrated one year of marriage. We did not go out, and we have yet to have a "real" honeymoon (hello, 2021? It's me, Jenny. I would like a tropical drink on a beach somewhere far away, please.) You *could* say that us holing up in our apartment together... basically all the time... is its own kind of honeymoon, but you'd be wrong! JK, we are still getting along famously. We've also taken up making cocktails at home, so there's that. Cheers. <3</li>
				<li>I miss live music, a LOT. But some of our friends are doing wonderful things in this gap. Namely: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/briangundersdorf/videos/vb.1120347862/10217075650659665/?type=2&theater" target="_blank">We're About 9</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jasontheband/" target="_blank">Jason Anderson</a>. They keep us sane, and we miss them a lot.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>December 2019/January 2020</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Returned to social media in December and it didn't add what I thought it would, so I'm back offline until... not sure! The experiment continues.</li>
				<li>Went quiet on my Bullet Journal over the holidays, but I'm back into it for the new year, to keep better track of my goals & day-to-day life.</li>
				<li>Been desperately trying to downsize my possessions as a path to a happier apartment life, which is a hard task for me. Trying to find new perspectives that help me to let go of Capital-S-Stuff.</li>
				<li>This month: Making as many plans with friends as I can, especially people I didn't see during the holiday craziness.</li>
				<li>Trying to wrap my head around a tropical vacation locale in February enough to firm up plans with Brian (neither one of us has been to a tropical destination before.)</li>
				<li>Taking stock of the music I loved most in 2019, and who I most want to see live in 2020.</li>
				<li>Incorporating more of these things in January: Long walks, BA-tested vegetable recipes, reading, baby-sized knitting (for my nephew!), documentaries.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>November 2019</h2>
			<ul>
         			<li>Still off social media sites (since the beginning of October)... but I can't always stay logged out. Text me pictures of your dogs & kiddos, please!</li>
          			<li>^ Probably going to write a Medium post about this soon. ^</li>
          			<li>Bullet Journaling in my personal life to be more productive (being off of Instagram, FB & Twitter has helped with this a lot, to be fair)</li>
          			<li>Trying out Bullet Journaling at work, too, and it's been helpful so far.</li>
          			<li>Figuring out which holiday things I want to see & do in & around Boston this year.</li>
          			<li>Brainstorming fun stocking stuffer gifts, which is the approach my family is taking for gift exchanges this year.</li>
